Same as GlazeWM, but it uses a spiral (Fibonacci/Dwindle) layout that arranges windows in a shrinking spiral pattern, giving each new window progressively smaller space while keeping all windows visible and organized efficiently. It also includes a .ahk script, which I find useful: Right-click held plus mouse scroll moves the current window to different workspaces, while left-click held plus scroll just switches the current workspace.

Note: Default behavior is now that window spawns on the workspace with the cursor.
