Same as GlazeWM. But default's A spiral (Fibonacci/Dwindle) layout in a tiling window manager arranges windows in a shrinking spiral pattern, giving each new window progressively smaller space while keeping all windows visible and organized efficiently. Also included a .ahk which I find useful. Right Click down (held) plus mouse scroll moves the current window to different workspaces. Left Click down (held) scroll just swithes the current workspace.
