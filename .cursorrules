## Project Overview

GlazeWM is a window manager written in Rust, organized as a workspace with multiple crates.

### Crate Organization

- `wm` (bin): Main application, which implements the core window management logic.
  - Gets installed to `C:\Program Files\glzr.io\glazewm.exe`.
- `wm-cli` (bin/lib): CLI for interacting with the main application.
  - Gets installed to `C:\Program Files\glzr.io\cli\glazewm.exe`. This is added to `$PATH` by default.
- `wm-common` (lib): Shared types, utilities, and constants used across other crates.
- `wm-ipc-client` (lib): WebSocket client library for IPC with the main application.
- `wm-platform` (lib): Wrappers over platform-specific API's - other crates don't interact directly with the Windows and macOS API's.
- `wm-watcher` (bin): Watchdog process that ensures proper cleanup when the main application exits.
  - Gets installed to `C:\Program Files\glzr.io\glazewm-watcher.exe`.

## Rust General Guidelines

### Code Style & Formatting

- Use the project's rustfmt.toml configuration:
  - Maximum line width of 75 characters.
  - Use field init shorthand when possible.
  - Wrap comments to fit line width.
- Follow clippy suggestions unless there's a compelling reason not to.
- Use rust-analyzer with clippy for continuous linting.
- The project uses the nightly Rust toolchain. However, only use nightly features when they provide clear benefit.
- Avoid `.unwrap()` wherever possible!

## Project-Specific Conventions

### Documentation

- Document public APIs with rustdoc comments, especially important for the `wm-platform` crate.
- Rustdoc comments should include (in the following order):
  - (required) A concise summary of the purpose of the function or type.
  - (required) Any notable caveats when using the function or type.
  - (optional) If unclear from the summary, include an additional note about the return type of the function (e.g. "Returns a vector of `NativeMonitor` sorted from left-to-right.").
  - (optional) Cases where the function might panic (use "# Panics" as heading).
  - (optional) Platform-specific notes (use "# Platform-specific" as heading).
  - (optional) Example usage (use "# Examples" as heading).
- Use punctuation marks at the end of doc comments and in-line comments.
- If using unsafe features, add a "SAFETY: ..." comment.

### Testing

- Use `#[cfg(test)]` for test modules.
- Write unit tests for core functionality.

### Module Structure

- Use `mod.rs` files for module organization
- Declare submodules with `pub mod module_name;`
- Re-export public APIs using `pub use module_name::*;` pattern
- Group related functionality in dedicated modules (e.g., commands/, events/, models/)

### Error Handling

- `anyhow` is being replaced with `thiserror` in the `wm-platform` crate. Please use `thiserror` for error handling within this crate.
- Use `thiserror` for custom error types with `#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error)]`
- Define `Result<T>` type aliases: `pub type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, Error>;`
- Use `anyhow` for application-level error handling
- Prefer `anyhow::Context` for adding context to errors
- Use transparent error forwarding: `#[error(transparent)]` with `#[from]`

### Logging & Tracing

- Use `tracing` crate for structured logging
- Log levels: `error!`, `warn!`, `info!`, `debug!`
- Set up logging with `tracing-subscriber` in main applications
- Error logs are saved to `~/.glzr/glazewm/errors.log`

### Async Programming

- Use `tokio` with full features for async runtime
- Use `tokio::select!` for concurrent event handling
- Handle signals gracefully (e.g., SIGINT for shutdown)

### Serialization

- Use `serde` with derive features for JSON serialization
- Use `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` for external APIs
- Use `#[serde(tag = "type", rename_all = "snake_case")]` for tagged enums
- Use `#[serde(flatten)]` for embedding structures

### IPC & Communication

- Use WebSocket protocol for IPC communication
- Default IPC port: 6123
- Message types should be strongly typed enums
- Use UUID for unique identifiers (client IDs, subscription IDs, etc.)

### Platform Abstraction

- Isolate platform-specific code in `wm-platform` crate
- Use conditional compilation: `#[cfg(target_os = "windows")]`, `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`
- Provide unified APIs that abstract platform differences
- Handle platform-specific errors appropriately

### Configuration & CLI

- Use `clap` with derive features for CLI parsing
- Support both start commands and IPC-based commands
- Use `#[clap(alias = "x")]` for short command aliases
- Support verbosity levels for logging control

### Container & Window Management

- Use tree-based container hierarchy for window organization
- Implement traits for common operations (getters, positioning, etc.)
- Use DTOs for serializing container state
- Handle window events through dedicated event handlers

### Memory Management

- Prefer owned types over references when crossing async boundaries
- Use `Arc` and `Rc` judiciously for shared ownership
- Clean up resources properly (windows, event listeners, etc.)
- Implement proper cleanup on application exit

### Build & Dependencies

- Use workspace-level dependency management in root Cargo.toml
- Pin dependency versions appropriately
- Use features flags to enable optional functionality
- Keep build times reasonable by minimizing heavy dependencies

## File Naming & Organization

- Use snake_case for file and directory names
- Group related commands in subdirectories (container/, window/, etc.)
- Use descriptive names that indicate functionality
- Keep module files focused on single responsibilities

## Code Review Guidelines

- Ensure all public APIs are properly documented, especially within `wm-platform`.
- Verify error handling is appropriate and consistent
- Check that logging is helpful but not excessive
- Confirm platform-specific code is properly abstracted
- Test both Windows and macOS code paths when applicable
